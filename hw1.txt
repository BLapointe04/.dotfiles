In this lab, I created a GitHub repo named .dotfiles and used Git to push 
the files from my terminal on my mac to the remote repo. I first began by 
logging into  my GitHub since I already have one and then generating the 
SSH key. I couldn't find that at first which had me worried from the 
beginning. After managing to find the key input and configuring the Git 
with my user and email I made the dotfiles, and then created the files 
needed for the dotfiles. Then I initialized the local repo and added the 
files to the staging area, did the commit, and then set up the remote repo 
on GitHub.
Now one of the main challenges I faced during this lab was dealing with 
the synchronization between my local and remote repos. When I tried to 
push my changes to github, I got rejected a lot because the remote repo 
contained previous commits that my actual local repo did not have. After 
going back through the instructions and redoing some work I was finally 
able to resolve my problem and connect and push the changes to Github. 
And then another challenge occurred while setting up my SHH key for the 
connection with GitHub. Initially I had some issues while trying to copy 
the key to my github but once again after rereading the instructions and 
using the correct file, I was able to authenticate. These challenges 
really showed me the value of rereading the instructions and making sure 
to pay attention to my work and how I go through the instructions. 
 By the end of the lab, I successfully managed to push my dotfiles repo to 
the github which contains all the files. I really did gain a better 
understanding of linking repo and githubs along with the value of closer 
reading, as well as being able to resolve issues when working with Git.
